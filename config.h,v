   stops changing their nick.

   NICK_CHANGE_T2_TIME is how long in seconds, a nick will "live" until its
   purged from the nick change table. Note, that it should be expired
   by the NICK_CHANGE_T1_TIME eventually, but if a nick manages to make
   a horrendous number of nick changes in a short time before being killed
   or k-lined, this will ensure it gets purged within a reasonable length
   of time (set to 5 minutes here)

   NICK_CHANGE_MAX_COUNT is the number of nick changes in a row allowed
   without NICK_CHANGE_T1_TIME before a nick flood is reported.
