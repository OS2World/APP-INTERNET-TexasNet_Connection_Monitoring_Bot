quickly install guide for tcm-dianora

  Read the config.h file. Its pretty self explanatory... the defaults
should be fine to start. If you want to play with AUTO_KLINE etc.
be sure to uncomment those defines out. Phisher, mbundy are using them
and I have been using them on irc.ionet.net  It really nails the
abusers especially at night..

  The Makefile defines what the OS is, etc.

  The biggie is the tcm.cf file Its pretty straight forward

# Username for the bot
U:db
# O line for the bot with password
O:dianora:noway
# Server for the bot
S:irc.mo.net:6666
# Nick for the bot
N:mobot
# Bot's IRCNAME
I:irc.mo.net connection monitor bot
# channel for the bot
C:&mo.net
# email address
# clone logs etc. will get emailed to this address
#E:

  Also included is a fix_help sh script
./fix_help irc.mo.net 
./fix_help irc.ionet.net 
etc. etc. just takes the help.txt.dist file, and customizes the
SERVER name to be yours. The help.txt file should be in the same
directory as the run, tcm binary and tcm.cf files

  run is a simple sh script, that keeps the tcm restarting if it
dies.

  So... when you have the tcm binary, and the help.txt file customized
for your server.. ./run& will start things up
The nice thing about the tcm.cf file is, you can share tcm binaries...
all you have to do is customize the help file and change the tcm.cf
